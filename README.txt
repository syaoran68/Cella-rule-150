This project is a simple html and javscript visual based on the cella-150 ruleset.
It uses p5 and javascript to manipulate the html generated canvas.

I used a simple grid array to mark the cell locations and used a nested for-loop to check each
each of the previous generations' cells. It would then compare the cells against the ruleset that
is pre-determined from the cella-150 ruleset. 

To run this application all you have to do is open the index.html file within a browser.

The hierarchy for the files should be as follows

Base (Base)
-> index.html
-> p5.js
-> assets (Folder)
    -> setup-function.js
    -> styles.css
